# MLB Database Analysis
Welcome to the MLB Database Analysis project! This undertaking is a testament to our proficiency in PostgreSQL and our commitment to showcasing our data analysis skills. Through meticulously crafted SQL queries, we aim to extract insightful information from the famous and extensive Lahman´s Baseball dataset. This dataset contains Major League Baseball’s complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2015, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, awards, post-season data, and more.





### Project Objective
Our primary goal is twofold: first, to demonstrate our expertise in SQL by unraveling the intricacies of the MLB database. Second, we envisage expanding this analysis in the future. The plan is to replicate these queries using Python's Pandas library, followed by the creation of captivating visualizations for each set of results.

### Dataset Overview
This project hinges on a robust dataset encompassing vital tables like player, team, batting, salary, among others. Together, these tables offer a panoramic view of player profiles, team compositions, game statistics, and financial aspects within the MLB.

### Key Highlights
Throughout this analysis, we'll embark on a journey through various facets of the MLB database:

* Player Performance Analysis: From identifying the best hitters in history by home runs to ranking players by various metrics, we delved into player performance.
* Team Dynamics and Financial Trends: We analyzed aspects like team salaries, attendance, and compensation structures, shedding light on financial dynamics within the league.
* Historical Trends and Milestones: The project examined historical trends in various aspects of the game, such as strikeouts, home runs, and team wins, providing insights into the evolution of baseball.
* Comparative Analysis: We conducted comparative analyses, including cost-effectiveness of teams and salary disparities, offering valuable perspectives on team strategies and financial distributions.

### Future Endeavors
In the forthcoming stages of this project, we envision transitioning from SQL to Python's Pandas library. By replicating these queries, we aim to demonstrate our proficiency in data manipulation using an alternate tool. Subsequently, we'll embark on creating dynamic visualizations to breathe life into the analytical findings.

### Project Structure
To facilitate the navigation and utilization of this project, we've organized it as follows:

* SQL--> Queries.sql: This directory houses the SQL queries employed in the analysis.
* SQL--> Tables and variables.sql: here you'll find SQL scripts capturing every variable type change and modification made throughout the project, ensuring transparency and replicability of all alterations.
* DATA: This directory encompasses all relevant datasets used in the analysis.


### Getting Started
Before diving into the analyses, make sure you have access to a PostgreSQL database with the Lahman´s Baseball dataset imported: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seanlahman/the-history-of-baseball/download?datasetVersionNumber=2 

 This will be crucial for executing the queries provided in the SLQ--> Queries.sql directory.




Welcome to the MLB Database Analysis project by Vicente and Andres. We're utilizing PostgreSQL and SQL to examine the Lahman's Baseball dataset, which contains extensive baseball statistics from 1871 to 2015. Our primary objective is to demonstrate our analytical skills using SQL and, in the subsequent phases, replicate the analysis in Python.


**Objective**
Our project aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the MLB database, showcasing our expertise in SQL and data analysis. The key objectives are:

1. Exploratory Analysis: We have completed a thorough exploration of the MLB database using SQL.
2. Python Replication: Our next step is to replicate our SQL-based analysis using Python's Pandas and Polars libraries.
3. Efficiency Assessment: We will evaluate the efficiency of Python Polars as compared to Pandas.
4. Data Visualization: Our analysis will include the creation of informative data visualizations, including Tableau dashboards and potentially leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn.
5. Machine Learning: In the final phase, we will apply machine learning techniques to predict trends in baseball statistics and assess model accuracy using data beyond 2015.

**Dataset Overview**
We are working with tables such as player, team, batting, and salary, which provide comprehensive insights into players, teams, and financial aspects within MLB.

**Highlights**
Key areas of our analysis encompass:

1. Player Performance: Identifying top-performing players in terms of home runs and other relevant metrics.
2. Team Insights: Analyzing team-related aspects, including salary structures, attendance, and player compensation.
3. Historical Trends: Investigating historical trends in baseball statistics, such as strikeouts, home runs, and team victories.
4. Comparative Analysis: Conducting comparative analyses, including cost-effectiveness of teams and salary disparities.

**Roadmap**
Our project roadmap is as follows:

- SQL: We have completed the SQL analysis.
- Python Pandas: Our next step is to replicate the SQL results using Python's Pandas library.
- Python Polars: After the Pandas phase, we will use Python Polars to replicate and assess the difference in efficiency between Pandas and Polars.
- Data Visualization: We will create data visualizations, including Tableau dashboards, as well as explore Matplotlib and Seaborn for Python-based graphs.
- Machine Learning: In this final phase, we will apply machine learning techniques to predict trends in baseball statistics and assess model accuracy using data beyond 2015.

**Future Updates**
We are committed to keeping this project updated as we progress through our roadmap
(and maybe include an interactive web page using HTML and CSS).
