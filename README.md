# MLB Database Analysis
Welcome to the MLB Database Analysis project! This undertaking is a testament to our proficiency in PostgreSQL and our commitment to showcasing our data analysis skills. Through meticulously crafted SQL queries, we aim to extract insightful information from the famous and extensive Lahman´s Baseball dataset. This dataset contains Major League Baseball’s complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2015, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, awards, post-season data, and more.





### Project Objective
Our primary goal is twofold: first, to demonstrate our expertise in SQL by unraveling the intricacies of the MLB database. Second, we envisage expanding this analysis in the future. The plan is to replicate these queries using Python's Pandas library, followed by the creation of captivating visualizations for each set of results.

### Dataset Overview
This project hinges on a robust dataset encompassing vital tables like player, team, batting, salary, among others. Together, these tables offer a panoramic view of player profiles, team compositions, game statistics, and financial aspects within the MLB.

### Key Highlights
Throughout this analysis, we'll embark on a journey through various facets of the MLB database:

* Player Performance: Scrutinizing individual player statistics such as homeruns, hits, homeruns per at bat, ando more that can help us to identify standout performers.
* Team Analysis: Delving into team-centric metrics to understand the factors contributing to a team's success or areas that require improvement.
* Salary Trends: A comprehensive exploration of player salaries, ranging from distributions and averages to identifying potential disparities.
* Awards and Achievements: Spotlighting players with exceptional achievements and accolades.

### Future Endeavors
In the forthcoming stages of this project, we envision transitioning from SQL to Python's Pandas library. By replicating these queries, we aim to demonstrate our proficiency in data manipulation using an alternate tool. Subsequently, we'll embark on creating dynamic visualizations to breathe life into the analytical findings.

### Project Structure
To facilitate the navigation and utilization of this project, we've organized it as follows:

* SQL--> Queries.sql: This directory houses the SQL queries employed in the analysis.
* SQL--> Tables and variables.sql: here you'll find SQL scripts capturing every variable type change and modification made throughout the project, ensuring transparency and replicability of all alterations.
* DATA: This directory encompasses all relevant datasets used in the analysis.


### Getting Started
Before diving into the analyses, make sure you have access to a PostgreSQL database with the Lahman´s Baseball dataset imported: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seanlahman/the-history-of-baseball/download?datasetVersionNumber=2 

 This will be crucial for executing the queries provided in the SLQ--> Queries.sql directory.
